# Game Snake

To start the game, run SnakeGame.main() method.
To control the snake, use key: ↑ , ↓ , ← , →.
To gain more length, eat appearing fruits.
The snake won't die in case if it reaches the border, instead the snake will just teleport to the opposite side of the field.
The snake gains speed with every eaten fruit until the speed reaches fixed number.
In case if the snake dies, your score will be written in the Score.txt file.
To restart the game, run SnakeGame.main() again.

 Some required features or issued to be solved:
 1) Entire body of the snake should be painted correctly (rectangle parts must be replaced with painted ones).
 2) There should be timer, which shows how much time elapsed from the start.
 3) This timer should be shown in the GameOver panel, as well as it must be written in the Score.txt file.
 4) There should be buttons, first of which should restart the game and second one should close the GameOver panel.
 5) There should be some barriers that snake can overcome in order to make game a little more entertaining.
 6) There could be some bonuses: temporary score multiplier, temporary speed boost/slowness, length reduction etc.
 7) Score.txt file should be replaced with integrated Database.
